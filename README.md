# NetStack

## Overview

This project is for studying and implementing various network protocols. The implementation order is not fixed; protocols will be added based on learning progress and practical needs, without forcing a bottom-up approach.

## Project Plan

* **Branches**: Each protocol is developed in its own branch for clean isolation and easier maintenance.
* **Directory Structure**: The repository is organized into subdirectories grouped by protocol category or layer.
* **Implementation Style**: Each protocol is implemented independently. Integration into a more complete stack will be considered only when feasible.

## Goals

* Deepen understanding of network mechanisms by implementing protocols directly.
* Build a collection of runnable and verifiable protocol implementations.
* Provide a foundation that can be extended step by step, rather than a one-time finished stack.

## Progress

Development speed depends on available time and current study focus. No strict timeline is set. Updates will be added continuously.
